# Protocol

This document describes the Happier wire protocol as implemented in `apps/server`. The protocol is intentionally small: JSON over HTTP for reads/actions and Socket.IO for real-time sync. Most payloads are end-to-end encrypted client-side; see `encryption.md` for the encryption boundaries and encoding details. For the full HTTP surface and auth flows, see `api.md`.

## Transport and versioning
- HTTP API: JSON requests/responses on `/v1` and `/v2` routes.
- WebSocket: Socket.IO server at path `/v1/updates` (transports: websocket, polling).
- CORS: `*` (server-side).

## Protocol design motivations
The protocol is designed to stay minimal, explicit, and resilient under intermittent connectivity. A few guiding principles shape naming, payloads, and versioning:

- **Small surface area over completeness.** Routes and events exist only when they provide a clear sync primitive (e.g., sessions, artifacts, KV). If a capability can be expressed as data within an existing primitive, it should be.
- **Explicit event types and short keys.** Update payloads use `t` for the event type and concise field names (`sid`, `id`, `seq`) to keep message size down without hiding meaning. These names are stable because they are used across clients.
- **Separation of persistent vs. ephemeral.** Anything that must be recoverable after reconnect is an `update` event with a sequence number. Presence and usage are `ephemeral` to avoid state confusion and minimize storage.
- **Monotonic ordering at the user level.** `UpdatePayload.seq` is a single per-user counter. This makes client reconciliation simple: apply updates in order and you are consistent for that user.
- **Optimistic concurrency by default.** Versioned fields (metadata, agent state, artifact parts, access keys, KV) require `expectedVersion`. This prevents silent overwrites and keeps conflict resolution client-driven.
- **Client-side encryption boundaries.** The server never needs to understand plaintext. The protocol therefore treats most payloads as opaque strings or base64 blobs, which keeps server logic simple and privacy guarantees strong.
- **Released compatibility over breaking changes.** Evolve released routes/events additively or through explicit negotiation and seam-owned translation; do not mutate existing wire semantics in place or create competing domain owners. Baselines, mixed-version directions, predecessor rules, and removal conditions are defined in `compatibility.md`.
- **Avoid full REST verbs.** Reads are primarily `GET`, while writes/actions are primarily `POST`, with `DELETE` used when the intent is unambiguous. We avoid the full REST palette because many mutations are not cleanly tied to a single entity or involve more than CRUD logic. Keeping to `GET` + `POST` (plus occasional `DELETE`) makes the client simpler and the protocol clearer.

If a new protocol field or event is proposed, it should answer: does this create a durable sync primitive, or can it be encoded inside existing encrypted payloads without expanding the API surface?

## Authentication
Most endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The same token is also used in the Socket.IO handshake. Full auth flows and endpoints are documented in `api.md`.

## WebSocket connection
### Handshake
Connect with Socket.IO using:

```
path: "/v1/updates"
auth: {
  token: "<bearer token>",
  clientType: "user-scoped" | "session-scoped" | "machine-scoped",
  sessionId?: "<session id>",
  machineId?: "<machine id>"
}
```

Rules enforced server-side:
- `token` is required.
- `session-scoped` requires `sessionId`.
- `machine-scoped` requires `machineId`.

### Connection types
- `user-scoped`: receives account-wide updates.
- `session-scoped`: receives updates for a specific session only.
- `machine-scoped`: used by daemons; receives machine updates and emits machine state.

### Connection churn and message sends

Clients remain polling-first for Socket.IO connections. This preserves the current proxy and self-hosted server compatibility path. The client does not force WebSocket transport or shorten the global Socket.IO heartbeat. A send acknowledgment timeout now provides a narrower failure signal. It forces a new authenticated reachability probe and a fresh Socket.IO handshake without adding heartbeat load to every connection.

Current development clients send active-session messages through `session.userMessage.sendReplaySafe.v1`. The request includes the message `text`, its exact `localId`, and sanitized `meta`. Current development daemons register this method beside the legacy `session.userMessage.send` method. Both names use the same exact-outcome registry.

The daemon retains up to 1,000 exact outcomes and never evicts an in-flight outcome. While an outcome is retained, the same `localId` and payload settle to that outcome. A different payload with the same `localId` is rejected. After an acknowledgment timeout, the client reconnects and replays the replay-safe method once with the same request. The immediate churn retry therefore settles against the retained delivery instead of starting a second provider delivery.

A new client falls back to `session.userMessage.send` only when the daemon reports that the replay-safe method is unavailable. If a legacy send acknowledgment times out, the client reconnects but does not replay that send. It keeps the local message visible with an uncertain delivery state. Message contents are not included in recovery logs.

### Server -> client events
The server emits two event types:

#### `update`
Persistent sync events. Payload shape:
```
{
  id: string,
  seq: number,
  body: { t: string, ... },
  createdAt: number
}
```

#### `ephemeral`
Transient presence/usage events. Payload shape:
```
{
  type: string,
  ...
}
```

## HTTP endpoints by area
See `api.md` for the full HTTP endpoint catalog and auth flows.

## Sequencing and concurrency
- `UpdatePayload.seq` is the per-user update sequence (monotonic) used for sync ordering.
- Sessions, machines, and artifacts have their own `seq` fields used by clients for ordering.
- Versioned fields (metadata, agentState, daemonState, artifact header/body, access keys, KV) use optimistic concurrency with `expectedVersion` and return a version-mismatch response containing the current version/data.
