/**
 * The ONE answer to "where does this session thing open — a pane, or a whole screen?".
 *
 * The app has always known the answer; it just knew it in four places. A transcript file link asked
 * `resolvePaneLayout` whether a details pane could exist and pushed `/session/<id>/file` when it
 * could not; the header's files button asked the same question about the RIGHT pane and pushed
 * `/session/<id>/files`; the header's agents button asked nothing at all and opened a pane that is
 * structurally hidden on a phone (a dead control); and the Agents pane asked `deviceType === 'phone'`
 * instead of the layout, so a narrow tablet window got the opposite answer from the row directly
 * above it. Four spellings of one decision is how a control ends up alive on one surface and dead on
 * the next.
 *
 * So the decision is here, once, as a pure function: given a target and the layout that would result
 * from opening the pane it wants, say whether it becomes a pane placement or a full-screen route.
 * Nothing here navigates — the hook (`useOpenSessionTarget`) applies the placement, because pushing
 * and dispatching are effects and this is the part worth testing without a renderer.
 *
 * **A target names WHAT is being opened, never WHERE.** That is the whole point: a caller that
 * already knew whether it wanted a tab or a route would be making this decision a fifth time.
 *
 * **The probe is "the layout that would exist if this pane were open", not the current one.** A pane
 * that is closed right now can still be opened; asking about the present layout would refuse to open
 * the first one.
