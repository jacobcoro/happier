/**
 * Integrity gate for the vendored `@legendapp/list` patch.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The patch carries five behaviour fixes for defects that fail SILENTLY when the hunk is lost —
 * one of them leaves the whole transcript permanently invisible. `patch-package` regenerates the
 * patch from whatever is in `node_modules` at the time, so a regeneration performed against a
 * partially-reverted tree drops hunks without any error. Nothing then fails until a user reports
 * the symptom.
 *
 * The check people reached for first — `git apply -R --check <patch> --directory=node_modules` —
 * is VACUOUS here: it resolves the patch's `node_modules/...` paths against the repo root, where
 * the package is not hoisted, so it prints "Skipped patch" for every file and exits 0 even for a
 * deliberately corrupted patch. `patch -p1 --dry-run -R` does discriminate, but `patch(1)` is not
 * reliably present on Windows, which this repository treats as first-class. So this gate asserts
 * the installed ARTIFACTS instead: pure `fs`, no external binary, same answer on every platform.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROVES
 * That each documented fix is present in every runtime build a consumer can resolve. It does not
 * re-verify hunk context; it answers the question that actually matters — "is the fix installed".
